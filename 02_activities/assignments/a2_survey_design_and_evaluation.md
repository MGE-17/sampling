# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1. In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2. Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3. Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios

1. You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2. You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3. You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s)
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used:

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design:

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:

Find out why the company has been struggling to retain entry-level and lower-level talent.
gather insights on potnetial improvemtns that could enhance retention and overall job satisfaction.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

```

The target population for this survey consists of all individuals who have voluntarily or involuntarily left the company within the past two years, across all departments and entry- to mid-level positions.
Sampling frame: HR records from the past 2 yeras
Sampling units: We will send a mass email to everyone enticing them to take a short survey.
Sampling strategy: A census of available contacts will be attempted (survey sent to all ex-employees in the frame). The survey will measure factors related to employee dissatisfaction, workplace environment, compensation, management, and career growth to identify drivers of turnover.

```

- Better pay or benefits elsewhere
- Limited career growth opportunities
- Poor management or leadership
- Unsatisfactory work-life balance or schedule
- Workplace culture or environment
- Long commute or remote work preferences

4. How satisfied were you with the following aspects of your job before leaving?  
   _(1 = Very dissatisfied, 5 = Very satisfied)_
   - Compensation
   - Management support
   - Career development opportunities
   - Work-life balance
   - Recognition and appreciation
5. Did you feel your feedback or concerns were heard by management?

- Always
- Often
- Sometimes
- Rarely
- Never

6.  How likely would you be to recommend this company to a friend seeking employment?

- Very likely
- Likely
- Neutral
- Unlikely
- Very unlikely

7. What changes do you believe would improve employee retention at this company?  
   _(Open-ended response)_
8. Would you consider returning to work for this company in the future if changes were made?

   - Yes
   - No
   - Maybe

9. write your question here... (optional)
10. write your question here... (optional)

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```

1. Sample type: The sample is based on a stratified design employing probability sampling. The stratification is done at the province/census metropolitan area (CMA) level. Information is collected from one randomly selected household member aged 15 or older, and proxy responses are not permitted.

2. Sample size: 24000

3. Target population: The target population for the GSS Giving, volunteering and participating includes all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.

4. Sampling frame: This survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame.

5. Survey mode(s): Survey mode: Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI).
   The design also employed ‚Äúrejective sampling,‚Äù where non-volunteers were subsampled into short or long interview versions.

6. Timeline: Every 5 years, from September to December

7. Response rate: The overall response rate is 41.9%.

8. Weights: When a probability sample is used, as was the case for this survey, the principle behind estimation is that each person selected in the sample represents (in addition to himself/herself) several other persons not in the sample. For example, in a simple random sample of 2% of the population, each person in the sample represents 50 persons in the population (himself/herself and 49 others). The number of persons represented by a given respondent is usually known as the weight or weighting factor. Furthermore, in order to adjust for the 'rejecting' of a proportion of respondents that are not volunteers, the person weight for respondents that are not 'rejected' and are not volunteers is multiplied by a factor. Finally, the weights were adjusted so that the weighted income distribution of GVP matched the 2017 CIS distribution by province

9. &
10. Data processing:

Cleaning, imputation, etc: Edits were performed automatically and manually at various stages of processing at macro and micro levels. They included family, consistency and flow edits. Family relationships were checked to ensure the integrity of matrix data. A series of checks were done to ensure the consistency of survey data. An example was to check the respondent age against the respondent birth date. Flow edits were used to ensure respondents followed the correct path and fix off-path situations. Error detection was done through edits programmed into the CATI system

All survey records were subjected to computer edits throughout the course of the interview. The CATI system principally edited the flow of the questionnaire and identified out of range values. As a result, such problems were immediately resolved with the respondent. If the interviewer was unable to correctly resolve the detected errors, the interviewer bypassed the edit and forwarded the data to head office for resolution. All interviewer comments were reviewed and taken into account by head office editing.

11. Sources of error

- Non-sampling error:
  Common sources of these errors are imperfect coverage and non-response. Coverage errors (or imperfect coverage) arise when there are differences between the target population and the surveyed population.

- Coverage error:
  The frame for GSS was created using several linked sources, such as the Census, administrative data and billing files. Coverage was improved (over coverage and under coverage may still exist) if we compare it to the random digit dialing strategies used in the past.

- Other non-sampling errors:
  For the 2018 GSS significant effort was made to minimize bias by using a well-tested questionnaire, a proven methodology, specialized interviewers and strict quality control.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc

- Non-response bias:
  The main method used to reduce nonresponse bias involved a series of adjustments to the survey weights to account for nonresponse as much as possible.
